# Flutter Chrome Extension

The repository will provide a comprehensive exploration of how to create a Chrome Extension Flutter; covering fundamental concepts.

The true power of Flutter is its ability to create cross-platform applications allowing also to expand to the web and chrome extension; but some important questions to creating more powerful extensions continue as a mystery for me; for that reason this post is the beginning of journey for me to understand how to do it.

### The achieved goals 

- [x] Create a Chrome Extension with Flutter
- [x] Understand how to communicate between the background script and the content script
- [x] Use the ChatGPT API to summarize a page
- [x] Use `js` and `js_interop` to communicate between Dart and JavaScript


## What's next?

We covered how to use the Dart interop to call JS functions from the Dart code, and how to communicate between the extension components. I still have some pending goals to achieve using the extension. When I finish them, I will write something on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamescardona11/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jamescardona11_).
